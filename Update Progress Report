Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have made a website base. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have been spending the last week trying to figure out how to code a coloring book aspect to the website. So i can have a blanck sheet and have the user pick what they want on the card. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
So many,the most recent was that maybe it was too much for idle to handle or something. I tried to re-download a tkinter software and it ended up making it impossible to even open the idle app at all.
I had to delete a bunch of files of my computer and I had to delete and redownload idle. There are so many files and factors that just go into colors themsleves. I know I won't be able to have that many colors. 
I mentioned one of my goals was to add in a spotify portion to the cards but that's not going to happen. My goal is just to get this to work and hopefuly fit some of my goals. I'm going to go through it with my TA and if it's too much
then I will switch some of my goals and maybe simplify my project.
